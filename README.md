# hercules

**hercules**, the Roman God of Power, will provide you with the API for information related to IIT Kharagpur's academic life.

# Motivation

- No more ad-hoc scrapping code.
- No more JSON files in projects.
- Single source of truth for all the projects.
- Building stuff should be a fun and creative process and shouldn't be hampered by the difficulty in the procurement of data.

# Implementation

- I've tried to use microservices as extensively as possible without trying to enfore the design pattern.
Each service is responsible for a logical data entity and the corresponding table in the DB.  

- Inter service communication is currently carried over HTTP via `SendToService` function.  

- The `common` package provides the minimal scafolding which should be share across all the services.
Essentially, it houses the data types, custom errors, database queries and the `server` interface.
  
Current List of Endpoints:

### service-course
- [x] [`/course/timetable/{code}`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/course/timetable/MA61023): Timetable of a course given the course code.
- [x] [`/course/info/department/{code}`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/course/info/department/MA): List of all the courses offered by a department.
- [x] [`/course/info/faculty`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/course/info/faculty?name=Pratima%20Panigrahi&dept=MA): List of all the courses offered by a faculty member.

### service-department
- [x] [`/department/info/all`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/department/info/all): List of all the departments.

### service-faculty
- [x] [`/faculty/info/all`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/faculty/info/all): List all the faculty members at IIT Kharagpur.
- [x] [`/faculty/info/{code}`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/faculty/info/MA): List all the faculty members of a particular department.
- [x] [`/faculty/timetable`](https://hercules-10496.herokuapp.com/api/v1/faculty/timetable?name=Pratima%20Panigrahi&dept=MA): Timetable of a faculty member


## Roadmap

After laying down the basic infrastructure for the project, I plan to develop the API on a *needs* basis.   
This would mean that new endpoints would be developed on based on the use-cases around the problem statement.  
For the time being, I have a shortlist of projects which I think would benefit the most from the API provided by `hercules`.  

October 2019: Port `wimp` to use `hercules`.   
November 2019: Port `mcmp` to `hercules`.  
December 2019: Port `Kronos` to `hercules`.  
December 2019: Port `gyft` to `hercules`.  

### Contributing

I have commented a lot of possible improvements to the API as `TODO` in the code which can be good place to start.   
At the same time, new/parallel feature requests are welcomed and I would try my best to accomodate time to discuss them through.

Apart from contributing LoC, you can help us by discussing some of the techincal problems we are currently facing:
- [ ] Keep the DB updated: Schedule the scrapping of data from the source links and triage.
- [ ] Testing handlers, unit testing models and functional testing services.
- [ ] Deploy services after writing `docker-compose`.
